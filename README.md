# RepoListing APP in ReasonML

ReasonML webapp which displays repos related to numerous different languages -
sorted by number of stars.

Combining `jamesfriend's` two blogs:

* https://jamesfriend.com.au/a-first-reason-react-app-for-js-developers

* https://jamesfriend.com.au/routing-in-reason-react

Concepts from the second blog are used to extend the first one.
